title: Reading Temperature and Humidity Sensors with MaixPy
---

## Introduction

By attaching a temperature and humidity sensor module to MaixCAM, you can easily read the environmental temperature and humidity. This example uses the `Si7021` sensor, which can be driven via `I2C`.

The complete code is available at [MaixPy/examples/sensors/temp_humi_si7021.py](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy/blob/main/examples/sensors/temp_humi_si7021.py).

Note that the system image needs to be version `>= 2024.6.3_maixpy_v4.2.1`.
