# Using Thermal Infrared Image Sensors with MaixCAM and MaixPy

Currently, the official hardware product is not yet available. If you only need low resolution, you can purchase a serial or I2C module from online platforms like Taobao and drive it yourself. This document will be updated when the official high-resolution module is released.

For thermal infrared camera modules, you might consider options such as [K210 + MLX90640 Infrared Thermal Imager](https://neucrack.com/p/189) or [Heimann HTPA 32x32d Thermal Infrared](https://neucrack.com/p/199).
