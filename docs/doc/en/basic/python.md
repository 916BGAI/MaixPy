title: Basic Knowledge of Python
---

The tutorial documentation of MaixPy does not delve into specific Python syntax tutorials because there are already too many excellent Python tutorials available. Here, we only introduce what needs to be learned, provide guidance on directions and paths.

## Introduction to Python

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, dynamically typed high-level programming language.
* Interpreted: It does not require compilation, runs directly. The advantage is rapid development, while a minor drawback is the slower execution speed due to code interpretation on each run. However, most often, the bottleneck lies in the developer's code rather than the language itself.
* Object-oriented: It supports object-oriented programming, allowing the definition of classes and objects. Compared to procedural languages, it is easier to organize code. For more details, please search independently.
* Dynamically typed: Variables do not need to declare types, can be assigned directly, and the type will be automatically determined based on the assignment. This reduces code volume, but can also lead to type errors, requiring the developer's attention.

In conclusion, for developers unfamiliar with Python, it is very easy to get started as Python offers plenty of ready-to-use libraries, a large developer community, short application development cycles, making it highly worthwhile to learn!

## Python Environment Setup

You can install Python on your computer according to the Python tutorial you are following for learning.
Alternatively, you can connect to a device via MaixVision on MaixVision and then run the program on the development board.

## What Python Basics are Needed to Use MaixPy?

* Basic concepts of Python.
* Basic concepts of object-oriented programming.
* Basic syntax of Python, including:
  * Tab indentation alignment syntax.
  * Variables, functions, classes, objects, comments, etc.
  * Control statements such as if, for, while, etc.
  * Modules and importing modules.
  * Basic data types such as int, float, str, list, dict, tuple, etc.
  * Difference between bytes and str, and conversion.
  * Exception handling, try-except.
  * Common built-in functions like print, open, len, range, etc.
  * Common built-in modules like os, sys, time, random, math, etc.

Mastering the above foundational knowledge will enable you to smoothly program with MaixPy. With the help of subsequent tutorials and examples, if unsure, you can refer to search engines, official documentation, or ask ChatGPT to successfully complete your development tasks.

## For Developers Experienced in Another Object-Oriented Programming Language

If you are already proficient in an object-oriented language like C++/Java/C#, you simply need to quickly review Python syntax before starting to use it.

You can refer to resources like [Runoob Tutorial](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-tutorial.html) or the [Python Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).

Alternatively, you can explore individual developers' blogs, such as [Wow! It's Python](https://neucrack.com/p/59).

## For Developers with C Language Experience but No Object-Oriented Programming Experience

If you only know C and lack understanding of object-oriented concepts, you can start by learning about object-oriented programming concepts before diving into Python. It's relatively quick and you can search for video tutorials for entry-level guidance.

After following introductory video tutorials, you can then refer to documentation tutorials such as [Runoob Tutorial](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-tutorial.html) or the [Python Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) to get started!

Once you have acquired the basic knowledge, you can start using MaixPy for programming based on the documentation and examples.

## For Programming Beginners

If you have never dealt with programming before, you will need to start learning Python from scratch. Python is also quite suitable as an introductory language. You can search for video tutorials for specific guidance.

After mastering the basic syntax, you will be able to use MaixPy for programming by following examples provided.


### Using Built-in Packages

Python comes with many commonly used packages and APIs built-in, so if you encounter any issues, you can search for “Python using xxxx” and you might find a solution right away. This applies to various common tasks, such as file handling, networking, system operations, algorithms, and more.

For example:
For those who are new to Python and have only dabbled in basic microcontroller development, they might wonder why there are no examples in the documentation for reading and writing to SD/TF cards. The reason is that a file system is already running on the SD/TF card by default, so you can use Python’s file handling APIs to read and write files directly on the SD card:

```python
with open("/root/a.txt", "r") as f:
  content = f.read()
  print(content)
```
