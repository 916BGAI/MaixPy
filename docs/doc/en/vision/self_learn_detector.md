## MaixPy Self-Learning Detector

Similar to the self-learning classifier, the self-learning detector does not require training. Simply taking a few photos of the object to be detected can enable detection, which is very useful in simple detection scenarios.
Unlike the self-learning classifier, since it is a detector, it will provide the coordinates and size of the object.
